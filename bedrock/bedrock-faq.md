# Bedrock FAQ

## Can I create a bedrock server?

Yes, but the official bedrock server is not available on the server due to it being a exe and not a jar file. The only alternative to the bedrock is a nukkit server, as that is the only bedrock server that is supported by FMCS. The only downside is that, many of the latest bedrock things are not supported by nukkit.

## I'm having the server outdated error or the client outdated error?

If you are getting the server outdated error when joining a server, it means that the server is using a previous version and not supported by the latest client version.

If you are getting the client outdated error when joining a server, it means that the app is not updated to the current server version.

## My nukkit server does not start?

If you are having troubles trying to start your nukkit server and it is your first time starting one, then there is a a choice of languages to choose from, before the server can start.
