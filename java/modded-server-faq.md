# Modded Server FAQ

An eula.txt file download is below with eula set to true instead of downloading and updating the file.

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/eula.txt" caption="EULA DOWNLOAD" %}

## How do I create a modded server?

Follow the guide below to create a modded server:

1. Go to JAR/Version and choose custom JAR and choose N/A for Version.
2. Delete everything and download an updated eula.txt file above with no changes needed.
3. Download the installer **NOT** the ****universal from the official minecraft forge website [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).
4. Once the download has finished, double click the installer and choose install server and the file it should extract to. I recommend choosing another folder other than the default folder.
5. Once the installer has finished, before you go uploading the files and folders, rename the forge-universal.jar file to custom.jar or **IT WILL NOT WORK**.
6. Now upload the custom.jar, minecraft\_server.jar and libraries folder to the JAR folder using Filezilla **NOT** WebFTP as it does not allow the uploading of folders. A guide on how to get and use Filezilla is [here](../#how-to-get-and-use-the-recommended-ftp-client).
7. Restart the server and now your done!

If you have followed the above instructions then you will have no errors in creating a modded server.
