# Java FAQ

## Can I create a modded server?

Sure you can, but only verified users are allowed to create modded servers. Have not requested to be verified? Go to the FMCS HELP FAQ [Verification question](../#how-to-be-verified-and-do-i-need-to-complete-everything-on-the-verification-list).

Once you are verified you can head over to [Modded Server FAQ](modded-server-faq.md) to follow the steps and get started on creating the modded server.

Verification has been denied? Please go to the FMCS HELP FAQ [Verification question](../#how-to-be-verified-and-do-i-need-to-complete-everything-on-the-verification-list).

## Am I able to add a server icon to the server?

Yes, you are able to add a server icon to the server. Please upload a 64x64 png image named `server-icon.png` via FTP. Not sure which FTP and how to use it? Please follow [this](../#how-to-get-and-use-the-recommended-ftp-client) guide.

## Can I use BungeeCord with my server?

No, due to security reasons, freemcserver does not support or allow the use of BungeeCord or any other proxy systems. This is in the freemcserver.net terms of service which should have been read when using this or any other service. A link to the freemcserver.net terms of service is [here](https://freemcserver.net/site/tos).
