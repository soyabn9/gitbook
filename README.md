# FMCS HELP FAQ

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is an unofficial help page. If you want proper help please go to their discord support server \([FreeMcServer.net](https://discordapp.com/invite/u99dDtE)\).
{% endhint %}

Ok, now you have know the warning, you can carry on.

## Is the server free forever?

No, its not forever free but you are able to create a server and depending on what plan you have chosen you can get more amount of time than other hosts.

## What are the server types?

1.13 and above performance issue warning:

{% hint style="warning" %}
1.13 and above are really bad in performance and take a huge amount of ram. so when creating a server or moving to 1.13 and above please change the server type to high memory and reduce the view-distance to 3 in the server.properties file. Not doing so will cause a lot of performance issues and mostly crash the server on start.
{% endhint %}

### Always Online:

* Renew every 2 days
* 256 MB of RAM

### High Memory:

* Renew every 4 hours
* 1 GB of RAM

Both servers have an unlimited amount of slots and plugins.

{% hint style="info" %}
Servers that are not renewed within 20 days are deleted.
{% endhint %}

## I cannot create a server?

Servers are taken most of the time as it is a mostly free service, so the only help I can give is to tell you to wait, as servers that have been expired for a long time are automatically deleted, every five mins. Please check back later for a space.

## My server says its offline and I am unable to connect?

If the server is offline there is no way of connecting please check the console for any errors as to why it is offline and provide them the error when talking to the staff in the freemcserver.net discord. Link is provided in the warning at the top of this page.

## I just got my server suspended what can I do?

In recent changes to the use of cracked plugins, servers that are suspended are to be deleted. You are allowed to create one more server, but after that your account will be terminated. A ticket will still need to be created so that another server can be created.

If the server is suspended over something else, please open a ticket by going into your control panel and looking under support where it says tickets where it will redirect you to the page and click open ticket to create a ticket. Want to get help in creating a ticket? Follow the guide [here](./#how-to-open-a-ticket).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not say or hint that you have opened a ticket in their discord support server, otherwise your ticket will be closed under their discord server rules.
{% endhint %}

## Are plugins like Orebfuscator, Votifier and DynMap allowed?

Yes, those plugin are allowed and previously they were not but they have lifted some restrictions on them.

Orebfuscator is no longer forbidden but will use up a lot of CPU, so it will most likely to cause your server to be stopped, just not suspended.

Votifier and DynMap are now allowed to be listening on a specific network port, if configured on the 50000 - 51000 port range. DynMap will likely cause you server to be stopped due to it high CPU usage.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Use of the Votifier and DynMap plugins outside of the 50000 - 51000 port range will make your account be directly and permanently terminated.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Any kind of remote console, bots \(including, but not limited to Discord bots\), RCON are still forbidden and will lead to account suspension or termination.
{% endhint %}

## How to be verified and do I need to complete everything on the verification list?

The way to get verified is to go to your control panel and on the side is Account Verification click it and fill everything in.

Yes, you need to fill everything. But I don't have a phone number for telegram or telegram is blocked in my country what can I do? If you are unable to verify, freemcserver cannot do anything about it. Unable to verify = Your not going to be verified. It's as simple as that.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your request has been denied then please do not ask freemcserver staff on why it was denied. 

They have security reasons as to why they cannot give such information out. All they say is that you need at least 1 out of 42 requirements to get your request to be denied.
{% endhint %}

## My time keeps messing up and shows the wrong time?

Yes, the staff at the freemcserver.net discord know this as a just a UI bug. Nothing to worry about as your not getting scammed or anything. The server still follows the plan you have, its just the countdown is broken.

## How can I delete my server or my account?

Please take the time to think about it before carrying on. 

Once a server is deleted there will be no going back and freemcserver.net does not keep backups of anything so it will be permanently deleted.
